      "text": '''It was a warm summer night and Sarah and her husband Steve had just finished dinner. As they walked along the beach, they admired the stars twinkling in the night sky, feeling the cool breeze on their faces and the sand beneath their feet. But something wasn't quite right. Sarah had the feeling that someone or something was watching them, and she couldn't shake it. She tried to shake off the feeling, but it kept coming back.As they continued walking, they heard a faint sound in the distance. It sounded like a woman's voice, but Sarah couldn't make out what she was saying. Steve thought it must just be the sound of the waves crashing against the shore, but Sarah wasn't so sure.The sound seemed to be getting closer, and Sarah started to feel a sense of dread wash over her. As the sound got louder, Sarah realized that it was in fact a woman's voice, and she was singing an old lullaby. Sarah and Steve stopped walking and looked around, trying to locate the source of the voice, but there was no one in sight. Sarah's heart was pounding and she felt like she couldn't move.Suddenly, there was a figure in the distance. It was a woman, standing on the edge of the shore and singing the song. She was wearing a long white dress and was surrounded by a soft glow.Sarah and Steve were both terrified and didn't know what to do. They stood there, frozen in fear, as the woman slowly made her way towards them.As the woman moved closer, they could hear her singing the same song, but this time her words were louder and more distinct."Come to me my love, come to me and be mine. I will show you the secrets of life, the mysteries of death. I will take away all your sorrows and pain, and give you eternal bliss. Come to me, my love, come to me and be mine."Sarah and Steve were both scared, but for some reason, Sarah found herself drawn to the woman. She felt compelled to follow her and do as she asked.The woman reached out her hand and Sarah took it. As the woman's grip tightened, Sarah felt a chill run down her spine. The woman led Sarah and Steve to a nearby cave. Inside, they found a small room filled with candles and strange symbols drawn on the wall. The woman told them that she was an ancient spirit and that she was here to grant them eternal love. She said that if they stayed with her and accepted her offer, they would be together forever. Sarah and Steve looked at each other, unsure of what to do. They had heard stories about people who had made deals with spirits and had never been seen again. But Sarah was drawn to the spirit, and she couldn't help but feel a strange connection to her. She looked into the spirit's eyes and saw a deep and ancient wisdom. The spirit smiled at them and said, Follow me and I will grant you eternal love.Sarah and Steve both knew this was a dangerous proposition, but they also knew that they couldn't turn away. They reluctantly agreed and followed the spirit into the cave. Inside, the spirit showed them a secret chamber and said, This is the place where you will be together forever.Sarah and Steve looked around in awe. The chamber was filled with candles, and the walls were covered in strange symbols. The spirit told them that if they stayed in this chamber, they would never age and would be together forever.But there was a catch. The spirit warned them that if they ever left the chamber, they would be cursed with eternal sadness and sorrow. She said that if they ever tried to escape, they would be doomed to wander the earth forever, never finding true love. Sarah and Steve looked at each other. They knew this was a huge risk, but they also knew that they were in love and wanted to be together forever. So, they agreed to stay in the chamber and accepted the spirits offer. And so, Sarah and Steve stayed in the chamber forever, living in eternal love. They never aged, never changed, and never left. To this day, if you go to the beach on a warm summer night, you might hear a faint singing in the distance. Some say it is the spirit of Sarah and Steve, still in love, still singing their song of eternal bliss.'''
